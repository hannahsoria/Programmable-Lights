# Programmable-Lights

Description:
The goal of this project is to make a programmable light display. This is done through the use of a state machine. This state machine had two states that were execute and fetch. The fetch state retrieves the instruction from lightrom and execute carries out the proper corresponding action. The lights are displayed in a 8 bits and on the board as 8 green lights. The corresponding instructions determine what happens to the lights- whether they remain on or off. The instructions are represented through a 3 bit binary. There were 8 different instructions. This 3 bit binary number was represented on the board as three red leds. If the binary was a 1 the red led would light up. It would remain off if it were a zero. With given instructions the display shows the instruction given then the green lights change correspondingly. 
This project used three different files: lights, lightrom, and lighttestbench. The top level entity is lights and lightrom stores the data for lights. Lightrom holds the address and the data for the circuit. Lights gives the outputs: clock, reset, irview and lightsig. This two entities interact through internal signals which are PC and ROMvalue. Lights interacts with the light bench through the inputs clk and reset and the outputs irview and lightsig.
